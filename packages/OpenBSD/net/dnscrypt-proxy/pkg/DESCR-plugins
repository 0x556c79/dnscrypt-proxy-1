A collection of plugins for dnscrypt-proxy.

- example-ldns-blocking: This plugin returns a REFUSED response if the
query name is in a list of blacklisted names, or if at least one of
the returned IP addresses happens to be in a list of blacklisted IPs.

- example-ldns-logging: This plugin logs the client queries to the
standard output (default) or to a file.

Plugins that only work when using OpenDNS resolvers:

- example-ldns-opendns-deviceid: Some routers provide advanced support
for OpenDNS, and allow using a specific set of settings no matter what
their IP address is. Since they don't support dnscrypt, outgoing
encrypted queries can not be rewritten by these routers, and OpenDNS
will not recognize the router settings. This plugin adds a device
identifier to outgoing packets, so that router settings can be used,
even when using dnscrypt.

- example-ldns-opendns-parental-control: When using OpenDNS, this enables
the following filter set, if one hasn't been defined: lingerie, adult
themes, nudity, pornography, proxy/anonymizer, sexuality and tasteless.

- example-ldns-opendns-set-client-ip: If you defined a policy for your
network, this plugin allows using this policy no matter where you are,
and without interfering with the networks you are roaming on. This plugin
also allows using your IPv4 network settings even when connecting to OpenDNS
using IPv6.
